### Gradient waveforms used in the in vivo experiments

Note that:
* All waveforms are motion-compensated up to acceleration (https://github.com/filip-szczepankiewicz/Szczepankiewicz_MRM_2020)
* LTE waveforms were derived as sub-axes of the PTE waveform
* The .txt files are compatible with the FWF pulse sequence (See https://github.com/filip-szczepankiewicz/fwf_seq_resources)
* The .mat file is the employed result from the numerical optimization
* The timing of the waveforms was: duration = 43.44 ms, pause = 8.68 ms
